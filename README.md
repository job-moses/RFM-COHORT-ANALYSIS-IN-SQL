In the dynamic world of data analytics, one of the most compelling narratives emerges when we dive into customer behavior. This portfolio project is a testament to my proficiency in SQL and data analysis, showcasing the powerful insights derived from Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis, as well as Cohort analysis.

**RFM Analysis:**

Within this project, I demonstrate my expertise in RFM analysis, a strategic methodology that dissects customer data into three dimensions:

1. **Recency (R):** How recent are customer interactions?
2. **Frequency (F):** How often do customers engage?
3. **Monetary Value (M):** What is the monetary impact of these interactions?

My SQL skills come to the forefront as I meticulously segment the customer base, assigning scores to each dimension. This segmentation serves as the foundation for targeted marketing strategies, enabling businesses to tailor their approaches for enhanced customer satisfaction and revenue growth.

**Cohort Analysis:**

In parallel, Cohort analysis adds another layer of complexity and insight to this portfolio. By grouping customers based on shared characteristics or behaviors over time, I showcase my ability to reveal trends and patterns that inform marketing and retention strategies. The strategic use of SQL allows me to dissect cohorts and provide a nuanced understanding of customer journeys.

**Objective:**

This portfolio project is not just about numbers; it's a testament to my analytical prowess. The primary objectives include:

1. **Identify High-Value Segments:** Demonstrating my ability to pinpoint customers that significantly impact revenue.
2. **Enhance Targeted Marketing:** Showcasing how data-driven insights can inform personalized marketing strategies for different customer segments.
3. **Optimize Retention Strategies:** Highlighting the strategic use of data to refine retention strategies, ensuring long-term customer loyalty.

This portfolio project is a showcase of my skills in SQL and data analysis, providing a tangible example of how I turn raw data into actionable insights. It stands as a testament to my ability to leverage analytical techniques to inform strategic decision-making and drive business success.
